/**
 * An element annotated with [UnknownNullability] claims that no specific nullability
 * should be assumed by static analyzer. The unconditional dereference of the annotated value
 * should not trigger a static analysis warning by default (though static analysis tool may have
 * an option to perform stricter analysis and issue warnings for `@UnknownNullability` as well).
 * It's mainly useful at method return types to mark methods that may occasionally
 * return `null` but in many cases, user knows that in this particular code path
 * `null` is not possible, so producing a warning would be annoying.
 *
 *
 * The `UnknownNullability` is the default nullability for unannotated methods, so it's
 * rarely necessary. An explicit annotation may serve to document the method behavior and also
 * to override automatic annotation inference result that could be implemented in some static
 * analysis tools.
