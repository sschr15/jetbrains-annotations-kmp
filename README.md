# Jetbrains Annotations - Kotlin Multiplatform

A copy of Jetbrains' [java-annotations](https://github.com/jetbrains/java-annotations) library,
converted in-place (mostly) by the Jetbrains kotlin IDEA plugin's "Convert Java class to Kotlin file" utility.

**This is not an official Jetbrains resource**, but instead is a modified copy to support Kotlin Multiplatform targets.
